<h1 id="reading-stacks-season-2-distributed-paper-stacks">Reading Stacks
    Season 2: Distributed Paper Stacks</h1>
<p>In this season of Reading Stacks, we will host 4 episodes on
    different topics in distributed systems. In each episode, we will base
    our discussions on a fundamental paper in the field, and augment the
    discussion with interactive demos, tutorials, use cases of the concepts
    in real-world systems, and more.</p>
<p>The four episodes are:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Distributed Queues by Can Toraman <em>(May 15, 2024)</em></li>
    <li>Distributed Key-Value Stores by Ozan Sazak <em>(May 29,
            2024)</em></li>
    <li>Realtime State Sharing with CRDTs by Alperen Keles and Ozan Akin
        <em>(June 12, 2024)</em>
    </li>
    <li>Latency in Distributed Systems by Yigit Varli <em>(June 26,
            2024)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Below, you can find the abstracts for each episode.</p>

    <p>In this episode of Paper Stacks, Can Toraman will be discussing
        Achieving Task-Based Scheduling in Low-Latency Distributed Priority
        Queues.</p>
    <p>In modern distributed systems, managing the queue efficiently is
        crucial for performance and responsiveness. Especially in multi-tenant
        environments, prioritizing different tasks (based on customer, task
        type, etc) is crucial. Yet, this area is still not highly explored, as
        many companies solve it by using different queues. Well, are more
        optimal ways, and how are they achievable in a distributed setting?</p>
    <p>Distributed priority queues are still not highly explored in the
        academic environment, so will base our discussions on different
        theoratical and practical perspectives used in the industry: -
        Timestone, Netflix’s distributed queue used in its encoding service -
        ⁠B4, Google’s Wide Area Network to support requests from both GCP and
        Google applications. - ⁠Facebook’s FOQS to support horizontal scaling and
        multi-tenant environments - ⁠QPID: A Distributed Priority Queue with Item
        Locality</p>

    <p>In this episode of Paper Stacks, Ozan Sazak will explore the
        internals of Amazon Dynamo, a highly available and scalable key-value
        store.</p>
    <p>Dynamo, developed for Amazon’s critical services, addressed the
        internal needs of Amazon using techniques such as consistent hashing,
        quorum-like techniques, and eventual consistency.</p>
    <p>We’ll dive into the 2007 Dynamo paper, discuss the internals of the
        Dynamo, and the design decisions between the parts such as partitioning
        and replication.</p>

    State Sharing with CRDTs</h2>

    <p>In this episode of Paper Stacks, Alperen Keles and Ozan Akin will be
        discussing Real-Time Distributed State Sharing for Collaborative
        Applications using Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types(CRDTs).</p>
    <p>Sharing state between multiple servers and clients is extremely
        common today. When multiple users make concurrent updates on a shared
        data structure, the applications need conflict resolution strategies to
        ensure all users agree on the final state.</p>
    <p>CRDTs are one such mechanism for handling distributed state; the
        differentiating factors for CRDTs are (1) they don’t need a central
        server, (2) they are highly fault-tolerant, allowing users to work
        offline, and sync their work at arbitrary intervals.</p>
    <p>Within the episode, we will base our discussions on the 2011 paper by
        Marc Shapiro, discuss the usage of CRDTs in collaborative text editing
        in Zed Code Editor, collaborative canvases such as Excalidraw and Figma,
        and provide live demos on the internal workings of CRDTs.</p>

    <p>In this episode of Paper Stacks, Yigit Varli will be discussing the
        challenges of optimizing tail latencies in large-scale distributed
        systems.</p>
    <p>Distributed systems tend to serve a diverse set of users at
        geographically varying locations, with heterogeneous loads and
        requirements. Classically, such systems have optimized for “average
        latency”, which resulted in very high latency for a small subset of
        users, the so-called tail.</p>
    <p>In this episode, we will dive into ‘The Tail at Scale’ by Jeffrey
        Dean and Luiz André Barroso from Google, where we will explore system
        designs and techniques to handle high loads, ensuring smoother operation
        and improved user experience.</p>
