# Reading Stacks Book Club

Reading Stacks is a book club for Turkish-speaking people interested in advanced topics where software engineering and computer science meet. We meet bi-weekly to discuss specific books and papers. We also share our notes and resources in this repository.

This README documents the roles in this book club and how to manage or participate in a meetup by maximizing the fun and learning.

## How to participate

## Structure

The club is designed to meet bi-weekly and discuss decided resources, such as book chapters or papers.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a strict rule book, but a guide that outlines the suggested format for the best meetup experience for every attending individual.

<!-- ### Before the meetup

If there is no currently decided resource, a new resource will be selected from the list of suggestions. Club organizers will send an anonymous poll to all members to vote for the next resource, and the next resource will be selected based on the poll result. Organizers will also announce the selected resource in club announcement channels such as Twitter, along with the next meetup date, time and first host.

The pool of resources is maintained in the [Resources](./RESOURCES.md) doc. -->

### Before the meetup

The vision for this club is to encourage a public debate on the books and topics we discuss, as well as facilitate an environment for actively producing content. We encourage everyone to take notes about their thoughts, be it short or long, handwritten or typeset, and add them to the `Notes` folder of the public repository for the resource.

The club will have two mediums of communication. (1) A mailing list/google group for the weekly discussions as well as public announcements, (2) a set of GitHub repositories for archiving and sharing the notes and resources.

Our mailing list is hosted at [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/reading-stacks). We will send out the meeting links and announcements through this mailing list.

The chapters/papers to be read for each meetup will be announced on the mailing list two weeks before the event. Three days before the event, the host will publish three to six questions alongside a set of notes/summaries to be discussed during the meetup. The participants are encouraged to share their notes and questions to contribute to the discussion.

### During the meetup

Each meetup follows a similar structure:

1. **Introduction** (5 minutes): The host introduces the topic and the resource to be discussed.
2. **Discussion** (60 minutes with a 10-minute break at 30): The host leads the discussion by asking questions and encouraging everyone to participate. Mods will help to moderate the discussion and make sure everyone has a chance to speak.
3. **Conclusion** (5 minutes): The host summarizes the discussion and concludes the meetup.

### After the meetup

After the meetup, the host will share their notes in the mailing list. The notes should include:

- A summary of the discussion
- Additional resources for further reading
- A list of questions that were not answered during the meetup

The next meetup date/time, host and resource will be announced by the club organizers in the mailing list.
