# Reading Stacks Book Club

Reading Stacks is a book club for Turkish-speaking people interested in the advanced topics where software engineering and computer science meet. We meet bi-weekly to discuss specific books and papers. We also share our notes and resources in this repository.

This README documents the roles in this book club and how to manage or participate a meetup by maximizing the fun and learning.

## Structure

The club is designed to meet bi-weekly and discuss on the previously decided resources, such as book chapters or papers. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a strict rule book, but a guide that outlines the suggested format for the best meetup experience for every attending individual.

### Before the meetup

If there is no currently decided resource, a new resource will be selected from the list of suggestions. Club organizers will send an anonymous poll to all members to vote for the next resource, and the next resource will be selected based on the poll result. Organizers will also announce the selected resource in club announcement channels such as Twitter, along with the next meetup date, time and first host.

The pool of resources is maintained in the [Resources](./RESOURCES.md) doc.

### During the meetup

Each meetup follows a similar structure:

1. **Introduction** (5 min): The host introduces the topic and the resource to be discussed.
2. **Discussion** (50 min): The host leads the discussion by asking questions and encouraging everyone to participate. Mods will help to moderate the discussion and make sure everyone has a chance to speak.
3. **Conclusion** (5 min): The host summarizes the discussion and concludes the meetup.

### After the meetup

After the meetup, the host will share their notes in the club's social media channels. The notes should include:

- A summary of the discussion
- Additional resources for further reading
- A list of questions that were not answered during the meetup

The next meetup date/time, host and resource will be announced by the club organizers in the club's social media channels.
